        "Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition becomes False. Loops make code shorter, avoid redundancy, and make programs more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Loops:\n",
        "1. **for Loop:** The for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known already or when we want to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string. The for loop is often combined with the range() function, which generates a sequence of numbers. This makes it very convenient to run loops a fixed number of times.\n",
        "2. **while Loop:** The while loop is used when we do not know in advance how many times the loop needs to run. It continues to execute as long as the specified condition remains True. Once the condition becomes False, the loop terminates. However, care must be taken when using while loops because if the condition never becomes False, an infinite loop will occur.\n",
        "3. **Nested Loops:** Python also supports nested loops, which means having one loop inside another. The inner loop runs completely for every single iteration of the outer loop. In other words, for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop executes from start to finish. Nested loops are commonly used for working with multi-dimensional data structures such as matrices, where rows and columns need to be processed, or for generating patterns where both row and column logic are required simultaneously.\n",
        "4. **Control Statements:** Python also supports loop control statements such as break, which is used to exit the loop prematurely, continue, which skips the current iteration and moves to the next, and pass, which does nothing and is often used as a placeholder. Loops can also be nested, meaning one loop can exist inside another. This is particularly useful for working with two-dimensional data such as matrices.\n"
